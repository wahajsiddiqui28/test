                             <p>My question here is that, why are you looking for job after obtaining six internationally accredited certifications and learning more than 85 tools, techniques, therapies, and language patterns? You can be your own boss and not have to answer to anyone. You have the option of charging a premium and working with both Pakistani and international clients. This is how you can earn more while putting in less effort and having peace of mind.</p>
